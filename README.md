# Logistic Regression – Pass or Fail Prediction

This project demonstrates a **basic Logistic Regression model** using Python.
The model predicts whether a student will **Pass (1)** or **Fail (0)** based on the number of **hours studied**.

---

## 📌 Project Description

- Input Feature: **Hours Studied**
- Output Label: **Result**
  - 0 → Fail
  - 1 → Pass
- Algorithm Used: **Logistic Regression**
- Visualization: **Scatter plot and line plot**

This project is created for **learning and practice purposes**.

## 📊 Dataset Used

| Hours Studied | Result |
|--------------|--------|
| 1 | 0 |
| 2 | 0 |
| 3 | 0 |
| 4 | 0 |
| 5 | 1 |
| 6 | 1 |
| 7 | 1 |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

---

## 🚀 Steps Performed

1. Created a dataset using Pandas
2. Selected feature (Hours_studied) and target (Result)
3. Split the data into training and testing sets
4. Trained a Logistic Regression model
5. Checked model accuracy
6. Predicted results for new values
7. Visualized the data using scatter and line plots

---

## 📈 Visualization Explanation

- **Down points (0)** represent **Fail**
- **Up points (1)** represent **Pass**
- Scatter plot shows individual data points
- Line plot shows the trend from fail to pass

---

## ✅ Sample Output

- Hours studied = 6 → Pass (1)
- Hours studied = 2 → Fail (0)

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

- Understood how Logistic Regression works
- Learned how to prepare data for ML
- Practiced model training and prediction
- Learned basic data visualization
